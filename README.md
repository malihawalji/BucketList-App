# The Bucket List Journal

## *An app to keep track of all your goals!*

>This app is meant to help you keep track of your various bucket list items.
You can add several bucket list items, detail each with why it is important, 
who you would like to do it with and whatever else you would like to document. 
Everyone has passions and goals, whether it is a country you would like to visit, 
a career goal you are aspiring towards or a habit you would like to break. 
As an avid traveller and dreamer, this app definitely is something I would 
use frequently keeping me inspired.
